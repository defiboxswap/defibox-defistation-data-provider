    Defistation Data Provider REST API
</h1>

## Introduction

Data Provider API is a tool created for DeFi service providers to efficiently update TVL data to Defistation.

### URL Summary

In order to have your real-time TVL data displayed on Defistation, you must be issued an ID and API Key first. Please fill out the [Apply to be listed](https://forms.gle/SUPc87JiR8Nt4FMp7) form and wait for a Defistation representative to reach back out after the initial screening process.
To expedite the listing process, please make sure to provide as much detail as possible and complete the required fields in the application form.
After review, Defistation will contact your team member through the contact info provided in the application. We will invite you to a slack group through the e-mail ID you provide in the application to proceed with the listing process.
Once you join the Slack group, we will issue and individually send your project’s own ID & API Key as Basic Auth type through direct message.
You must enter the header in the following form: ‘Authorization: Basic XXXX…’.
The base URL for our API: `https://api.defistation.io/dataProvider`.

1. Fill out the "Apply to be listed" form (screening process will be taken place)
2. Wait until Defistation representative to contract
3. You will be given your project's ID and API key that needs to be kept within your organization.

| /tvl?from={from-timestamp}&to={to-timestamp} | Returns a list of TVL defi service provider posted | N/A             | N/A                               | N/A                                         |

## Use your ID and API Key

To enter tvl using the Data Provider API, you can use the API key in the following two ways. You can use project's ID and api_key. The second method can be encoded in Base64.

1. You can use CURL command using as
```sh
curl -u your_id:api_key https://api.defistation.io/dataProvider/tvl
```

2. Also you can do it with Basic auth template encoded on Base64:
```sh
curl -H 'Authorization: Basic Ym9veW91bjE6ZjI0OWJkMjAtMzM5My0xMWViLWJlZmQtMjM0Yjg4ZDIzXXXX'
```

Below is an example of encoding ID and API key with javascript.

```js
var clientId = "YOUR_ID";
var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx";

var authorizationBasic = window.btoa(clientId + ":" + clientSecret);
console.log("authorizationBasic: ", authorizationBasic);
```

## Add your TVL

You are required to enter your “tvl”, “volume” and locked “bnb” values (i.e. If you you do not have any BNB locked in your protocol, please enter 0). In “data”, please input all of contract information and contract addresses that are included towards your TVL count. Defistation will cross-check and verify the TVL value you input by calculating your TVL according to the contract list/address you provide with the data json value.
In “data”, please include all contract addresses that contain tokens, their respective token symbol, any contract addresses that contain your TVL count method, and any information/details/explanations that can help accurately calculate your TVL in json format.
There are no restrictions on the structure of “data” contents. The example below shows a json example using data.pairEntities key.
 If "test" value is set to true, it is not calculated.

1. Calculate your TVL and make a json file using your tvl, trading volume(24h), locked bnb, and data.
2. Send a tvl json as a POST type.

Defistation updates project TVLs every hour. You must post your TVL/locked BNB/json data 10 minutes before each hour (ex. 00:50, 01:50, 02:50, 03:50, ….., 23:50) - 24 times every day. Projects that fail to post their hourly up-to-date information for a prolonged period of time will be delisted from Defistation. Please keep your data up-to-date at all times. (i.e. The data you post at 01:50 will be displayed on Defistation at 02:00)

```sh
# Response

{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "pairEntities": [
            {

                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "message": null
}
```

## Check your TVL

You can check the TVL data entered in Defistation with GET TVL API. If you do not enter from, to timestamp values, the latest 24-hour data is displayed by default.

```sh
# Request
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.defistation.io/dataProvider/tvl?from=1502766805&to=1606803480' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic Ym9veW91bjE6ZjI0OWJkMjAtMzM5My0xMWViLWJlZmQtMjM0Yjg4ZDIzXXXX'
```

```sh
# Response
